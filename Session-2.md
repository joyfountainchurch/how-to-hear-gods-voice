**Hearing God’s Voice Course: Session 2 | The Voice Of The Stranger** 

Jesus taught that His sheep hear His voice and that the voice of a stranger they will not hear. He stated that we would FLEE from a stranger's voice. Amen\! 

John 10:1-6

The voice of a stranger is unfamiliar. We will look at a situation where a follower of Jesus, or anyone for that matter, may be oppressed by a familiar spirit in Session 4\.

Jesus sent His Holy Spirit to teach, comfort, empower, and guide us into all truth. Most of the time it is the voice of the Holy Spirit we hear as believers. 

John 14:15-18

**Who Is The Stranger?**

The stranger is the devil. Jesus taught us that he comes to steal, kill, and destroy. John 10:7-10

The devil was an archangel in heaven by the name Lucifer, who lost his place due to pride and wanting the Holy Throne for himself. You can read about this on your own in Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:11-19 for a learning exercise. 

**What are the stranger's other common names?** 

Thief, father of lies, murderer from the beginning, that old serpent, the dragon, prince of the power of the air, deceiver, the accuser, Beelzebub (lord of the flies), satan, the tempter. He is a stranger to you and me as children of God because he is evil, and God our Father is righteous. He is of darkness, and we are of the Light. John 8:12

The stranger has cohorts, and these are evil spirits (fallen angels, demons, devils), and humans who elect to serve the devil knowingly or ignorantly. One famous example is Judas. John 13:27; Elymas the Sorcerer, Acts 13:8-12; and Simon the Sorcerer of Samaria, Acts 8:4-13.

**The Voice Of The Stranger**

This stranger's strategy must be understood so that he does not gain an advantage over us.   
2 Corinthians 2:10-11. 

satan operates his enterprise of deceit **FIRST BY HIS VOICE**. This is what confuses many people because we are told he disguises himself as an angel of light. We see this in the Garden of Eden in Genesis 3:1-13.

In this passage from Genesis, we find the enemy speaking to Eve, offering her an opportunity to defy God's command.

When the Lord would come into the garden for His fellowship time with Adam and Eve, what was it that bothered them to the point of hiding themselves? "Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, 'Where *are* you?" So he said, "I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself." The Lord's voice rattled the corruption of the stranger's voice they had listened to. The stranger's voice aims to deceive, subvert, and create rebellion in those who listen to him.

In warfare, it is understood that you must have some knowledge about how the enemy operates in order to successfully defend and counter their attack. We must not give any opportunity to the devil to use his voice to deceive us. We cannot afford to be ignorant of his devices. Ephesians 4:27-30, Ephesians 6:10-13.

**Discerning and Exposing the Voice Of The Stranger (the devil)**

We cannot discern the voice of the enemy if we walk in darkness. Think of walking in a dark or poorly lit room. Even if it were your bedroom, your steps would be halting and not as confident as they would be if it were brightly lit. This is why most people have night lights for those moments. We MUST walk in the light\! Ephesians 5:1-21 offers a primer on what walking in the light looks like. 

**Resisting the Voice of satan and His Cohorts**

We have been provided with sufficient grace to defeat the enemy. In fact, the enemy is a defeated foe. You must remember that. Colossians 2:11-15

We are to submit to God first and then resist the devil. James 4:7-8

If satan's voice is how he performs his enterprise of deception, either directly or through proxies, well, we now know, and by first submitting to God and refusing to heed his temptations, we are resisting. Amen\! And what does he do when we resist? He flees\! Eve entertained his voice through the serpent, offering a **"better than this life"** than what God had already provided. The devil continues today to offer a **"better than this life"** through lying, covetousness, stealing, cheating, murder, adultery, fornication, and idol worship.

**10 Things We Should Do To Resist The Devil** 

1. Be familiar with the Lord's voice (Holy Spirit) by immersing ourselves in His word  
2. Refusing and rejecting the stranger's voice   
3. Being filled with the Holy Spirit. Notice how, after people received Jesus in the book of Acts, the next thing was to fill them with the Holy Spirit? Continue being filled with the Holy Spirit through the disciplines of prayer, fasting, scripture reading, study, and meditation   
4. Submitting to one another in the fear of God  
5. Obeying the word of God  
6. Speaking Psalms, Hymns, and spiritual songs   
7. Make church attendance a priority  
8. Ask for prayer when needed  
9. Be a worshipper of God all round (satan can't stand that)  
10. Cast out devils

**Conclusion:**

The most important skill in our Christian walk and work is hearing and acting on the Father's voice through His Holy Spirit. To reinforce this, Jesus taught that we should LABOUR for the meat that does not perish. Despite being in the temple and learning the priestly responsibilities, young Samuel, the trainee priest, didn't yet know the voice of the Lord. Eli, the Chief Priest, taught him the most valuable lesson in his life: "speak Lord, for your servant hears." 1 Samuel 3:1-11.

Let us declare together, **"We know the voice of our Lord Jesus. The voice of a stranger we will not hear."**
