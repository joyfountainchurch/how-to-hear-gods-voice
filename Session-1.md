Session 1 

Introduction And Overview.

The voice of God (The Father, Our Maker and Life Sustainer) has always been heard from creation and throughout scripture. His cvoice is valid today as it was then. Around the time of the birth of Christ, an Angel was sent from God to Mary a virgin while she was sitting at home to announce to her the Divine purpose for her life. Joseph was informed in a dream to take her as wife as he considered putiing her away for being found with child without a husband. An Angel warned the wise men from the East in a dream not to return to Herod. 

If the birth of the Saviour was surrounded by God’s voice distinctively punctuating the events surrounding Christ’s birth and if the voliume of scriptures show humans hearing clearly from the God of heaven why would it be strange in the spirit and idea of continuation to have the Lord speak to us today directly or through third parties? 

Here are some examples:

Old Testament Examples: 

* Creation. Genesis 1:1-6 "...Then God said let there be light and there was light..."  
* Prophet Samuel in 1 Samuel 9:15-17  
* Prophet Elisha knowing what the king of Syria had planned against Samaria 2 Kings 6:8-23  
* All the prophets: Prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1:1-4), Prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 38:4-8), Prophet Daniel (Daniel 10:1-7). Even ordinary people had visitations as well like Samson's mother and her husband Manoah Judges 13:1-21 

New Testament Examples: 

* As shown previously in the introduction  
* We will see this some more when we talk about the various ways God speaks to us with New Testament examples.

Why Today's Believer Must Learn The Father's Voice As A Priority.

* We are priests unto our God.   
* The primary role of a priest is to act as a mediator between God and the people performing sacred rituals and offering spiritual guidance.    
* The priest must first worship God in order to hear from Him for the people they represent.   
* We are in the world and not of the world

The Authority And Purpose of The Scriptures 

* 2 Timothy 3:16-17  
* Romans 15:4-5

4 Principal ways the Lord speaks to us.

You cannot miss His voice if you're paying attention or seeking to hear Him. 

Audible voice 

* An actual voice giving you instructions  

An Inner witness in your spirit   
* A voice or knowing within your spirit guiding you and confirming things to you

Through The Written Text 

* Some may ask why? The answer is because Scripture is God Breathed\!   
* Scripture text illumined by the Spirit. 

Through Third Parties

* Angels Luke 1:26-38, Daniel 9:1-27,   
* Other human agents: Ananias in Acts 9:10-19, Agabus in Acts 21:10-14,   
* Preachers and ministers of God. Acts 16:14  
* Other believers sharing their faith privately and publicly. Acts 8:1-6  
* God can use anything to send a message to you or anyone including inanimate objects

The Big Question Many Ask. Have you come across this question?

Why do some people struggle to hear even when they pray to hear God speak to them? They say God is not speaking to them. Could the problem be personal pride, an unrepentant heart, idol worship? Or could it be that they haven't been well taught/discipled?

1. Multitude of idols- Ezekiel 14:4    
2. (Sinfulness) The Lord detests the sacrifice of the wicked \- Proverbs 15:8    
3. Pride. The proud He knows far off \- Psalm 138:6   
4. Inflexible mindset \- Romans 12:1-2 

Conclusion

The first thing every human should and must hear from God is the call to salvation in Christ. Please don't get it wrong. God can speak to anyone. If he can speak to and through Balaam's donkey then he can definitely give instructions to anyone. However His desire is that all men should be saved, moreso John 3:16 shows God gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have ever lasting life. He wants us to hear His call to comeout of darkness to light before anything else. Matthew 11:28 says "Come unto me all you who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you an learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
